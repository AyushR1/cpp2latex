# Problem it solves

# Introduction

Writing research papers or technical documents can be a time-consuming task, and it is important to focus on the content rather than spend time on formatting. LaTeX is a powerful tool that allows for professional typesetting and formatting, but it can be difficult to use for writing pseudo code of C++ programs. The process of analyzing, setting up and getting it right can be quite tedious. Our web application, cpp2latex, solves this problem by providing an efficient and accurate conversion process for C++ code to LaTeX pseudo code. This enables authors to focus on the content and logic of the code, rather than spending time on formatting. cpp2latex is a valuable tool for programmers and researchers, as it simplifies the process of writing and formatting pseudo code, allowing for a more professional and polished final document.

We, as a team, encountered a complex problem that required the utilization of our programming skills to the fullest. After searching for various solutions, we were able to develop the most optimized solution with linear time complexity. The biggest challenge we faced was coding the entire solution in one day.

We utilized regular expressions to solve the problem and explored options involving Bash scripting, iterative code modifications, and parse trees. This required us to put our core computer science fundamentals, such as compiler design, theory of computation, and algorithm design analysis, to the test.

Additionally, we developed an API that could be used with our backend script. The API was designed to provide text input and output a solution on the same page without redirecting to other pages using Flask. The deployment of the web page on the new platform, Replit, also took some effort as it required learning new skills.

Overall, the process of building the solution was a challenging and rewarding experience that allowed us to showcase our skills and knowledge in programming and computer science.
