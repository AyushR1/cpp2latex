# Introduction

Writing research papers or technical documents can be a time-consuming task, and it is important to focus on the content rather than spend time on formatting. LaTeX is a powerful tool that allows for professional typesetting and formatting, but it can be difficult to use for writing pseudo code of C++ programs. The process of analyzing, setting up and getting it right can be quite tedious. Our web application, cpp2latex, solves this problem by providing an efficient and accurate conversion process for C++ code to LaTeX pseudo code. This enables authors to focus on the content and logic of the code, rather than spending time on formatting. cpp2latex is a valuable tool for programmers and researchers, as it simplifies the process of writing and formatting pseudo code, allowing for a more professional and polished final document.
